My duties for disaster recovery  included scripting the exercise, reserving the offsite recover facility, leading telephone conferences lading up to the exercise, arranging travel and lodging for participant as well as delivery of backup tapes to the recovery site. For new system development I was the point of contact for development communications, setting up daily task schedules and author of procedural documentation as well as task log forms.COMMUNICATIONAs described above, I was the point of contact and communications with other employees for new systems development and for disaster recovery when I worked for Bank of America.

I have also completed courses concentrated in the biological sciences with an emphasis on laboratory techniques. In addition, as an ambitious self-starter, I, in my spare time, have worked to familiarize myself with technical skills, such as programming in R and Python, in order to become more effective at data analysis. In this way, I work towards expanding my repertoire of knowledge in any way I can.\u00a0My previous work experiences showcase similar diversity. I have held positions relating to both neurobiological and biochemical research in which I developed critical thinking skills as well as a curious mind. In my most previous experience as a data analyst intern, I obtained hands-on experience, in a team-based environment, analyzing data and creating statistical models in order to predict the outcomes of horse races. My attached r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will describe my academic and experiential background in more detail.Throughout my educational and professional career, I have developed soft skills such as critical and analytical thinking, effectively communicating ideas, and being able to work independently as well as with a team. I truly believe that I can effectively utilize my background to make a valuable contribution to your team. I can be reached at (347) 405-2071 or an e-mail can be sent to petersalamon14@gmail.com.
